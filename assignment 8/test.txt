The Greeks engaged in the sea-service were the following. The
Athenians furnished a hundred and twenty-seven vessels to the fleet,
which were manned in part by the Plataeans, who, though unskilled in
such matters, were led by their active and daring spirit to undertake
this duty; the Corinthians furnished a contingent of forty vessels;
the Megarians sent twenty; the Chalcideans also manned twenty, which
had been furnished to them by the Athenians; the Eginetans came with
eighteen; the Sicyonians with twelve; the Lacedaemonians with ten; the
Epidaurians with eight; the Eretrians with seven; the Troezenians with
five; the Styreans with two; and the Ceans with two triremes and two
penteconters. Last of all, the Locrians of Opus came in aid with a
squadron of seven penteconters.
